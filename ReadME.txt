1. You can use jupyter to run all in one files, and then run them all to see the full results

2. Alternatively, run the three classifiers, which are Logistic.py, NN.py, SVM.py, They each import the entire contents of Dataprepare.py for training, then classify the test set, and finally output the results

Test.py will first import the contents of all files, then cross-validate the three classifiers, and finally output the results
